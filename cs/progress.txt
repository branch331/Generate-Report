8/18/18:

-removed text display for 'status' and instead just disable the controls on the UI while making a report
-replaced Overwrite button w/ checkbox

next steps:
-test on other computer since sys config driver is broken (labview example also doesnt make report)
-remove commented sections if works

*tested on same machine after restart, works so far for HTML. Remove comments and then merge w/ master

-works with different report types, just need to follow w/ test plan
-removed commented code
-see if there's a better way to decide between reporttypes, instead of the nested if statements in ongeneratereportclick
